/**
 * This defines the GUJO package.  GUJO stands for Gary's Unsigned Java Objects.
 * Since the Java language does not include unsigned primitives, this package
 * implements that functionality and gives these data types flexibility (e.g.
 * the unsigned byte object, UByte, has circular shift methods).
